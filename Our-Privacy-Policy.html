Life lessons
Computer has become necessity and it will be like making the kids ready for future. Nowadays in all the sector computer is must and during the class we also teach about computer general knowledge.
Make cool stuffs, Have fun!
Ever thought how this app or game works? Learning coding can enable you to imagine, think of new idea, plan about it and actually implement it without depending on anyone else.
Benefits
- Computational thinking and logical reasoning
When children begin to learn how to code, they are invited to begin thinking in a logical, step by step manner. This is another way of describing ‘computational thinking’, which allows children to organise and communicate their thoughts in a logical and rationalised way. Creating a computer program requires careful planning and working according to a logical sequence of events, and learners become practiced in this important cognitive skill.
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing problems in your computer program
- Creativity
Children are inherently creative and get excited about using their creativity to make their own computer programs. Coding encourages creativity in both the design of programs, and the way that they use their existing knowledge to achieve their goals when writing code. As children progress in their programming abilities, a whole world of creativity is opened up to them in a way they have not experienced before.
When coding, children learn how to make their objects move at different speeds and angles 
An algorithm is a step by step set of instructions used to achieve an objective or solve a problem
- Problem solving
An inherent part of learning to code is practicing problem solving. Any programmer will tell you that ‘debugging’, or finding and fixing the mistakes in your computer program, is one part of programming that occupies a large portion of their time. When coding, children learn how to find mistakes by working carefully through their programs, and solving the problems that they find. The method of problem solving used in coding translates to being used in other areas of their education.
Design mode is used for children to create their own programs by adding different backgrounds and characters
- Cross curricular benefits
Coding can be highly beneficial for both mathematical and language development. The logical thinking skills required for coding translate into maths skills, and learning the language of coding and  how the language is constructed will ultimately help develop language skills.
- Learning how computers work
Coding teaches children what is going on ‘underneath’ the interface that they interact with every day on their tablet or computer. They therefore become confident technology users, with a depth of understanding the technology.

What is coding?
Coding, also called as computer programming, is we use to communicate with computers. The Code which we write, tells a computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions.
By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a sequence. You can use computer programming to make games, apps or process data and do lots of other cool things.
What Age is Appropriate to Learn to Code?
Coding for kids is typically gamified making it fun for kids to learn!
Since coding can be gamified, kids as early as age 7 can start learning how to code using visual block interfaces or age appropriate text-based coding classes.
Kids computer programming courses using games, apps, and other kids-centric projects is a research-based approach that has been proven to teach real world skills in a way that keeps students engaged.
Why to learn coding?
Kids spend lots of time on mobile / laptop, They spend their time in playing computer games or so. If we channelize their interest in coding than they can learn and can build games, apps or other things on their own. They can start coding as hobby and later own it can be useful for their future also. We make learning so much fun so that anyone can learn coding.
At younger age if kids learn coding than when they actually need these skills they will be ready and much ahead in competition.

Life lessons
Computer has become necessity and it will be like making the kids ready for future. Nowadays in all the sector computer is must and during the class we also teach about computer general knowledge.
Make cool stuffs, Have fun!
Ever thought how this app or game works? Learning coding can enable you to imagine, think of new idea, plan about it and actually implement it without depending on anyone else.
Benefits
- Computational thinking and logical reasoning
When children begin to learn how to code, they are invited to begin thinking in a logical, step by step manner. This is another way of describing ‘computational thinking’, which allows children to organise and communicate their thoughts in a logical and rationalised way. Creating a computer program requires careful planning and working according to a logical sequence of events, and learners become practiced in this important cognitive skill.
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing problems in your computer program
- Creativity
Children are inherently creative and get excited about using their creativity to make their own computer programs. Coding encourages creativity in both the design of programs, and the way that they use their existing knowledge to achieve their goals when writing code. As children progress in their programming abilities, a whole world of creativity is opened up to them in a way they have not experienced before.
When coding, children learn how to make their objects move at different speeds and angles 
An algorithm is a step by step set of instructions used to achieve an objective or solve a problem
- Problem solving
An inherent part of learning to code is practicing problem solving. Any programmer will tell you that ‘debugging’, or finding and fixing the mistakes in your computer program, is one part of programming that occupies a large portion of their time. When coding, children learn how to find mistakes by working carefully through their programs, and solving the problems that they find. The method of problem solving used in coding translates to being used in other areas of their education.
Design mode is used for children to create their own programs by adding different backgrounds and characters
- Cross curricular benefits
Coding can be highly beneficial for both mathematical and language development. The logical thinking skills required for coding translate into maths skills, and learning the language of coding and  how the language is constructed will ultimately help develop language skills.
- Learning how computers work
Coding teaches children what is going on ‘underneath’ the interface that they interact with every day on their tablet or computer. They therefore become confident technology users, with a depth of understanding the technology.

What is coding?
Coding, also called as computer programming, is we use to communicate with computers. The Code which we write, tells a computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions.
By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a sequence. You can use computer programming to make games, apps or process data and do lots of other cool things.
What Age is Appropriate to Learn to Code?
Coding for kids is typically gamified making it fun for kids to learn!
Since coding can be gamified, kids as early as age 7 can start learning how to code using visual block interfaces or age appropriate text-based coding classes.
Kids computer programming courses using games, apps, and other kids-centric projects is a research-based approach that has been proven to teach real world skills in a way that keeps students engaged.
Why to learn coding?
Kids spend lots of time on mobile / laptop, They spend their time in playing computer games or so. If we channelize their interest in coding than they can learn and can build games, apps or other things on their own. They can start coding as hobby and later own it can be useful for their future also. We make learning so much fun so that anyone can learn coding.
At younger age if kids learn coding than when they actually need these skills they will be ready and much ahead in competition.

Should a third party approach us with a demand to access your personal information, we will take reasonable steps to redirect the third party to request the information directly from you, wherever it is lawful and reasonable for us to do so.
If we are compelled to disclose your personal information, to a third party we will take reasonable steps to notify you of this in advance, wherever it is lawful and reasonable for us to do so.
 
Security of Personal Information
In our organization, personal information may be stored both electronically and in hard-copy form. We are committed to keeping your personal information secure regardless of the format in which we hold it and we take all reasonable steps to protect your information from misuse, interference, loss, and unauthorized access, modification or disclosure. However, you use the Website at your own risk and we accept no responsibility, whether we are deemed to have been negligent or not, in the event of a security that affects your privacy.
Note that no information transmitted over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. However, we will endeavour to protect your personal information as best as possible but we cannot guarantee the security of any information that you transmit to us, or receive from us. The transmission and exchange of information is carried out at your own risk. 
 
Accuracy and Quality of Personal Information
We will take all such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that:
•   all information collected from you is kept accurate, up to date and complete; and
•   the personal information that we use or disclose is, having regard to the purpose of the use or disclosure, accurate, up-to-date, complete and relevant.
 
Access to Your Personal Information
We will deal with all requests for access to personal information as quickly as possible. Requests for a large amount of information, or information which is not currently in use, may require further time before a response can be given. 
We may charge you a reasonable fee for access if a cost is incurred by us in order to retrieve your information.
Whenever a fee will be applied, you will be notified of how that fee will be calculated, or where possible, the total amount that will be charged. You will then have the option to decide whether to proceed with your access request.
We will also refuse access where the personal information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings, and the information would not be accessible by the process of discovery in those proceedings. Further, we will refuse access where your request is frivolous or vexatious, and where we reasonably believe that: giving access would pose a serious threat to the life, health or safety of any individual, or to public health or public safety; unlawful activity, or misconduct of a serious nature, is being or may be engaged in against Fundo Kids and giving access would be likely to prejudice the taking of appropriate action in relation to that matter.
These mechanisms for accessing your personal information operate alongside, and do not replace, other informal or legal procedures by which you may be provided with access to your personal information.
 
Correction of Your Personal Information
The accuracy of the personal information we have requested from you is important to us. Should you suspect, or become aware of, that your personal information we hold is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete or misleading, please contact our Privacy Officer.
These mechanisms for correcting your personal information operate alongside, and do not replace, other informal or legal procedures by which you may be provided correction of your personal information.
 
Overseas Transfer of Personal Information 
We may transfer your personal information to overseas recipients. However, we will seek your consent prior to disclosing your information if the overseas recipient is not regulated in a way that equally reflects the Indian Privacy Principles. 
Concerns and Complaints about Breaches 
If you have concerns about how we handle your personal information, it is important that you notify us as soon as possible, so that we can address your concerns appropriately as the circumstances require. Any concern or complaint should be made in writing. Please send it to our Privacy Officer and we will respond as soon as reasonably possible. 
 
Contacting Us
If you have any questions, concerns or ideas about how we could improve our Privacy Policy, please contact our Privacy Officer.  Where you provide suggestions, materials or feedback it is considered non-confidential and we may, at our complete discretion, use it to improve the Website, service and/or how we handle personal information without any obligation to compensate you regardless of how we use, implement, copy, modify, display, distribute and/or otherwise benefit from your suggestions, materials or feedback.
 
Amendments of this Privacy Policy
We are obligated to regularly review and update this Privacy Policy. We therefore reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time.
